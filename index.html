        <h2 class="title">Assessment process</h2>
        <p>Rosemary Cottage strives to help residents to achieve greater independence, by providing a safe home and ongoing psychosocial support that is unique to each individual.</p>
        <p>Careful assessment of each person admitted to the home is carried out prior to admission. This assessment, alongside any assessment completed by a referring professional and involvement from the resident, is then used to put a package of care and support in place that will enable each person to be as independent as possible.</p>
        <p>We encourage the development of former skills and interests, as well as providing opportunities for new experiences to enrich residents lives. Additionally, by providing relapse prevention support in a safe and secure environment we intend to help our residents to achieve personal aspirations and maximise their abilities. The team at Rosemary Cottage encourage links with a residents family; often lost when lives are disrupted by drug or alcohol abuse.</p>
